## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the `.env-simple` file and rename it to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env-simple .env
   ```

4. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your Hugging Face API token:

   ```env
   VITE_HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
   ```

5. Make sure the `.env` file is **ignored by Git** by adding it to `.gitignore` if itâ€™s not already included.

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default port).

3. Add ingredients using the input field and click **Add ingredient**.

4. Click **Get a recipe** to generate a meal suggestion based on your ingredients.

5. The recipe will be displayed in formatted Markdown for easy reading.
